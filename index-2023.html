&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. David Mohaisen, University of Central Florida<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Title: Understanding the Privacy Dimension of Wearables through Machine Learning-enabled Inferences<br>
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract: To keep up with the ever-growing user expectations, developers keep adding new features to augment the use cases of wearables, such as fitness trackers, augmented reality head-mounted devices (AR HMDs), and smart watches, without considering their security and privacy impacts. In this talk, I will introduce our recent results on understanding the privacy dimension of wearables through inference attacks facilitated by machine learning and open research directions. First, I will present an exploration of the attack surface introduced by fitness trackers. We propose an inference attack that breaches location privacy through the elevation profiles collected by fitness trackers. Our attack highlights that adversaries can infer the location from elevation profiles collected via fitness trackers. Second, I will review the attack surface introduced by smartwatches by developing an inference attack that exploits the smartwatch microphone to capture the acoustic emanations of physical keyboards and successfully infers what the user has been typing. Third, I will present an exploration of the AR HMD’s through the design of an inference attack that exploits the geometric projection of hand movements in the air. The attack framework predicts the typed text on an in-air tapping keyboard, which is only visible to the user. I will conclude with lessons learned, defense directions, and open research directions.
